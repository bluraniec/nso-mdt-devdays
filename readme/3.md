## Chapter 2 - Telemetry Application Stack 2/3: COLLECTOR

Configure **Telegraf** data collector to gather streams with data from IOS-XR devices and push them to the InfluxDB database.  

### 1st step - Download Telegraf
1. Continue with previously opened **Terminal**. Download Telegraf collector:  
```console
root@ubuntu:~/# apt-get update && sudo apt-get install telegraf
```

### 2nd step - Create yourn own telegraf.conf
Configuration of the Telegraf collector is by default placed in the `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`. Telegraf is shipped by default with large variety of input and output plugins – due to that, telegraf.conf  contains all commented definitions that might support your requirements.

You can check as well full `telegraf.conf` file here: https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/telegraf.conf 
In our case we only want to use small part of it: 
-	**input** plugin that supports **IOS-XR GRPC** - [[inputs.cisco_telemetry_mdt]]
-	**output** plugin that supports **InfluxDB** database – [[outputs.influxdb]]

1.	It a best practice to keep the default `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` file unchanged and use its content in order to build your custom configuration file. Following that rule, create a new blank telegraf.conf file inside main root directory:  
```console
root@ubuntu:~/# cd /root
root@ubuntu:~/# touch telegraf.conf
```

### 2nd step - Telegraf.conf: INPUT
To consume data streams sent by the router on the collector side – respective configuration has to be provided in the newly created *telegraf.conf* file. Use **vim** or **nano** in order to provide there respective configuration:  
```console
# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
  ## Log at debug level.
  # debug = false
# Cisco model-driven telemetry (MDT) input plugin for IOS XR, IOS XE and NX-OS platforms
[[inputs.cisco_telemetry_mdt]]
  ## Telemetry transport can be "tcp" or "grpc".  TLS is only supported when
  ## using the grpc transport.
  transport = "grpc"

  ## Address and port to host telemetry listener
  service_address = ":57000"
```

### 3rd step - Telegraf.conf: OUTPUT
In order to be able to send further collected data-streams to the database – enable InfluxDB by **appending** respective configuration under the *telegraf.conf* file using **vim** or **nano**:  
```console
# Configuration for sending metrics to InfluxDB
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  ## The full HTTP or UDP URL for your InfluxDB instance.
  urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:8086"]

  ## The target database for metrics; will be created as needed.
  ## For UDP url endpoint database needs to be configured on server side.
  database = "TELEMETRY_DATA"
```
Your new complete telegraf.conf should look following:

### 4th step - Synchronization
Run script in order to make sure that Ubuntu VM with collector and database is synchronized with XR devices:
```console
root@ubuntu:~/# python /root/synchronize.py
```

### 5th step - Run Telegraf
Open Terminal and run Telegraf collector: 
```console
root@ubuntu:~/# telegraf --config /root/telegraf.conf
```
Input InfluxDB credentials,   
**Username:** admin  
**Password:** admin  

Keep it opened, don't close it. You should see similar output:

### 6th step - Confirm metrics are in the InfluxDB
Login to Ubuntu using shortcut in the Desktop which will simulate SSH connectivity to the Virtual Machine through the Putty software.  

1. In the CLI issue command influx to run the InfluxDB:
```console
root@ubuntu:~/# influx
```
2. Choose database TELEMETRY_DATA where you will store all collected data: 
```console
> use TELEMETRY_DATA;
```
3. See if new table with telemetry data has been created:
```console
> show measurements;
```
4. You should see BGP neighbor table with metrics:  
<img align="center" width=60% src="/readme/2B_5.png"></img>
5. In order to verify if metrics are pushed, you can issue the following query:
```console
> select neighbor_address, connection_state from "Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-bgp-oper:bgp/instances/instance/instance-active/default-vrf/neighbors/neighbor";
```
Then example table entries in the database will look like:
